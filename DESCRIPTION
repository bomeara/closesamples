Description: Often you want to pick species at random, but don't
    have access to all the possible species, and your group might be a
    nonrandom set. However, you might have a taxonomy, perhaps a bad one,
    for all the species. This will let you pick species at random on that
    full taxonomy and then pick a species out of the possible set closest
    to this. You could still have a biased sample, but way less biased.
