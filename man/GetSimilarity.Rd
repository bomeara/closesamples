\name{GetSimilarity}
\alias{GetSimilarity}
\title{Get similarity
Uses ape's cophenetic.phylo to get patristic distances between pairs of taxa, then makes the diagonals Inf. If the tree has no branch lengths, makes every edge length 1.}
\usage{
GetSimilarity(phy_full, taxa_possible)
}
\arguments{
\item{phy_full}{A phylo object with all possible taxa to sammple from}

\item{taxa_possible}{A vector of taxon names that are possible to study (often on another tree)}
}
\value{
A matrix with tips on the rows and columns and patristic distances in the cells. Rows are tips on the phy_full tree, columns are taxa in the taxa_possible vector
}
